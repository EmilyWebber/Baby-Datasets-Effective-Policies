# Steps for creating baby data sets.

## Simple. Easy. Critical. Like all the best things in life.

1. People
- I need one person (over 6 years old, under 16). White. Female.
- For each of the states in the control-state-list.
- For each of the years from 2000 to 2014. 
- I also need all of their columns. 

2. Policies
- Pick a policy from the State of Illinois, enacted in 2007. 
- Put in a csv with State, Year Enacted, Policy Name. 

3. Control State List
- I got the 11 most normal states from a Business Insider 2014 news article right here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-average-states-in-america-2014-4#11-michigan-1. They claim that Illinois is the "most normal" out of all 11 states listed. They used 31 indicators from the 2012 American Community Survey, along with 2012 unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
